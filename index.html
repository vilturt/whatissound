    <p class="leftered">Sound, and music, is variation of the flow and pressure of air. An object such as 
        string of a violin vibrates creating the sound you can hear with your ears. The variation of 
        frequences created form the melody part of music. There is always also rythm involved.

    <p class="leftered">An artist is someone who can compose music out of sound with the help of an instrument.
        There are various instruments. Some of them are electric. Some of them are acoustic. Some common instruments
        are piano, guitar and violin. These all have unique qualities that differ with each other. You can synthesize 
        sound of an instrument. A device capable of doing this is a synthesizer. It can be played basically with 
        a special keyboard called a MIDI keyboard.

<p class="leftered">When an artist wants to create a piece of music, a song or a track, of some sort, he or she 
    can use these special kind of tools. These usually include a computer with some special software, like sequencer,
    audio editor, virtual effects and instruments and some interface that he/she can create the melodies and produce 
    tracks for drums and basslines.
